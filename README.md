WATER DROPS
Hello fellow Charity Water bucket holders, 
I made a game that’ll allow students of all ages to be engaged. I think it 
will be both a competitive and fun game. With bright colors and bold 
images we can draw younger generations to try out our game.Water 
drops is a fast-paced, reflex-based game where players collect falling 
drops of clean water while avoiding contaminated ones. Each round 
lasts just a few minutes, making it perfect for study breaks, social 
sharing, and casual play on laptops or phones. As players progress, the 
game speeds up, creating that “just one more round” feeling that keeps 
people coming back. 

How to play:
First you will click on the app, the app will then have you push the start button when 
you are ready. There is an arrow placed at the bottom that moves the water 
bucket from left to write to catch the clean water. There is also a timer 
on there to see how many you can catch to fill the bucket. When the player succeeds they are rewarded with some coins and when they fail they lose a life. Side note: when you collect some 
contaminated droplets, the water bucket goes down a little. The score is updated based on your level. When you leave off on that level it doesn't start all over, you start on 
that same level which over time the game becomes harder. When the water is dropped in the bucket it will make a splash sound. When the timer starts at .10 seconds, .10 will start flashing red as a warning. When the timer stops and you have not filled the bucket it will 
make an error sound. When the bucket is filled before the timer runs 
out, you will get a bravo sound. The game ends when you have filled the 
bucket with clean water. If you win, when the game ends, the water will shoot out coins 
for the winner. On the other hand if you lose when the game ends, there 
will be a crack in the bottom of the bucket that will let all the water out 
and you will lose a life. To continue on if you still have life left, there will 
be a button that says start with coins on top of the start button. You will 
have to use a small amount of your coins.
